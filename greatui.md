# Great UI Design Command

When asked to create a UI, follow this comprehensive approach to achieve exceptional, immersive interface design.

## Phase 1: Theme Exploration & Research (First 20%)

### Deep Dive Questions
- What is the core subject matter? Research authentic terminology, visual language, and cultural context
- What emotions should users feel? (excitement, nostalgia, tension, comfort, etc.)
- What real-world interfaces inspire this? Study actual examples
- What story does this interface tell through its design?

### Example Research Process
For SCP Foundation theme:
- Studied real government/military interfaces
- Researched CRT monitor characteristics
- Explored ASCII art and terminal aesthetics
- Analyzed SCP wiki document formats

## Phase 2: Immersive Design Principles

### Go Beyond Surface Theming
❌ Don't just change colors and fonts
✅ Do create a complete sensory experience

### Layer Your Effects
1. **Base Layer**: Core visual theme (colors, typography)
2. **Atmosphere Layer**: Environmental effects (scanlines, noise, gradients)
3. **Interaction Layer**: Micro-animations and feedback
4. **Narrative Layer**: UI elements that tell a story

### Technical Authenticity
- Use period-appropriate design patterns
- Include realistic imperfections (flicker, noise, delays)
- Research actual technical constraints of the era/theme

## Phase 3: Detailed Design Specification

### For Each Page/Component Define:

1. **Visual Design**
   - Exact layout with ASCII mockups where appropriate
   - Color usage and meaning
   - Typography hierarchy
   - Special effects and animations

2. **Interactions**
   - Hover states with specific behaviors
   - Click/tap feedback (visual and audio)
   - Transition timings (use realistic delays)
   - Error states and edge cases

3. **Micro-interactions Examples**
   - Cursor: Custom shapes, blink rates
   - Buttons: Not just color change but complete transformation
   - Forms: Thoughtful placeholders and validation
   - Loading: Themed progress indicators

4. **Sound Design** (even if not implemented)
   - Ambient background sounds
   - Interaction feedback sounds
   - Alert/notification audio
   - Consider frequency ranges that match theme

## Phase 4: Implementation Excellence

### CSS Architecture
```css
/* Always use CSS variables for theming */
:root {
  --primary-color: #00ff00;
  --bg-color: #0a0a0a;
  --transition-fast: 150ms;
  --transition-normal: 300ms;
}

/* Layer effects properly */
.container {
  position: relative; /* For pseudo-element effects */
}

.container::before {
  /* Atmospheric effects */
}
```

### Performance Patterns
- Use CSS transforms over position changes
- Implement `will-change` for heavy animations
- Consider `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Lazy load heavy visual effects

### Progressive Enhancement
1. **Level 0**: Clean, functional interface
2. **Level 1**: Basic theme and colors
3. **Level 2**: Animations and transitions  
4. **Level 3**: Advanced effects (particles, 3D)
5. **Level 4**: Experimental features (VR, spatial)

## Phase 5: User Journey Design

### Create Anticipation
- Boot sequences
- Progressive reveals
- Teaser animations
- Loading as part of the experience

### Maintain Engagement
- Vary interaction patterns
- Hide easter eggs
- Reward exploration
- Change UI based on user actions

### Example Flow
```
Landing → Intrigue (boot sequence)
        ↓
Setup  → Guidance (clear but themed instructions)  
        ↓
Action → Feedback (real-time visual responses)
        ↓
Result → Satisfaction (dramatic reveal/presentation)
```

## Phase 6: Accessibility & Inclusivity

### From the Start, Not After
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation paths
- Focus indicators that match theme
- High contrast mode option

### Respect User Preferences
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Disable non-essential animations */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Already dark? Make it accessible dark */
}
```

## Phase 7: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-designing**: Every effect should serve a purpose
2. **Ignoring Performance**: Test on low-end devices
3. **Forgetting Context**: Consider where/how users access this
4. **Skipping User Testing**: Watch real people use it
5. **Inconsistent Details**: Maintain theme everywhere

## Phase 8: Inspiration Resources

### For Retro/Terminal UIs
- Old computer manuals and documentation
- Sci-fi movie interfaces (Alien, Blade Runner, Tron)
- Actual terminal emulators and DOS programs
- ASCII art archives

### For Modern UIs  
- Dribbble/Behance case studies
- Award-winning sites (Awwwards, FWA)
- Design systems (Material, Carbon, Polaris)
- Game UI galleries

### For Experimental UIs
- Creative coding communities (CodePen, ShaderToy)
- Generative art
- Data visualization galleries
- AR/VR interface experiments

## The Success Formula

**Great UI = (Deep Theme Understanding + Thoughtful Interactions + Technical Excellence + User Empathy) × Attention to Detail**

### Remember:
- The best themed UIs feel like you're using a real artifact from that world
- Every pixel and millisecond matters
- Delight is in the details others overlook
- Performance is part of the experience
- Accessibility is non-negotiable

## Quick Checklist

When designing any UI, ask yourself:

- [ ] Does this feel authentic to the theme?
- [ ] Are the micro-interactions delightful?
- [ ] Is there a clear visual hierarchy?
- [ ] Does it work without JavaScript?
- [ ] Can keyboard users navigate it?
- [ ] Does it perform well on mobile?
- [ ] Is there a story being told?
- [ ] Would I enjoy using this?
